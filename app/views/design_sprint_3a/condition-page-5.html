<h2>Treatment</h2>

<p>If you have chlamydia a health professional will give you antibiotics. It's usually one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="azithromycin">azithromycin</a> - you'll take 2 or 4 tablets at once, by mouth</li>
<li><a href="doxycycline">doxycycline</a> - you'll take 2 capsules a day for 1 week, by mouth</li>
</ul>

<p>You might be given antibiotics before you get your test results. This could happen if it's likely that you have chlamydia, for example you have symptoms.</p>

<p>After you've finished the antibiotics, you may be told to have another chlamydia test to check it's gone.</p>
