<h2>Treatment for chlamydia</h2>

<p>If you have chlamydia, you’ll be given antibiotics. You can only get these from a health professional after getting tested.</p>

<p>You’ll usually be given either:</p>

<ul>
	<li>2 or 4 tablets you take on 1 day</li>
	<li>2 capsules you take once a day for 1 week</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes you might be given antibiotics before you get your test results if it's likely you have chlamydia.</p>

<h3>When you can have sex again</h3>

<p>Don’t have vaginal, oral or anal sex (even with a condom or oral sex dam) until you and your sexual partner have completed treatment. </p>

<p>If you had the one-day course of antibiotics, don’t have sex for at least 1 week.</p>

<p>This is so you don't pass on the infection or get it again.</p>

<h3>When to get tested again</h3>

<p>Sometimes you may be asked to get tested again after a few weeks to check treatment has worked. </p>

<p>If you’re under 25, you might be asked to have a test after a few months to check you haven’t been infected again. This is because you’re more likely to get re-infected if you’re under 25.</p>

<p>Any sexual partners should be told they could have chlamydia so they can get tested and treated if needed. This will help stop you getting infected again.</p>

<p>If you're under 25 and sexually active, it’s recommended you keep getting tested every year and whenever you change sexual partner.</p>
