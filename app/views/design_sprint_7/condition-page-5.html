<h2>Treatment for chlamydia</h2>

<p>If you have chlamydia a health professional will give you antibiotics. It's usually one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="azithromycin">azithromycin</a> - you'll take 2 or 4 tablets at once, by mouth</li>
<li><a href="doxycycline">doxycycline</a> - you'll take 2 capsules a day for 1 week, by mouth</li>
</ul>

<p>You might be given different antibiotics if you have an allergy, or you're pregnant or breastfeeding. </p>

<p>If you get tested by a health professional, they might give you antibiotics before you get your test results. This could happen if it's likely that you have chlamydia, for example you have symptoms.</p>

<p>If you have chlamydia, you should not have vaginal, oral or anal sex (even with a condom or oral sex dam) until you and your sexual partner have completed treatment. This is so you don't pass on the infection or get it again.</p>

<p>After you've finished the antibiotics, you should get tested again to check that the chlamydia infection is gone.</p>
