<h2>Treatment for chlamydia</h2>

<p>You’ll be given antibiotics if you have chlamydia. You can only get these from a health professional.</p>

<p>You’ll usually be given either:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 or 4 tablets you take on one day</li>
<li>2 capsules you take once a day for 1 week</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes you might be given antibiotics before you get your test results if it's likely you have chlamydia.</p>

<h3>When you can have sex again</h3>

<p>Don’t have vaginal, oral or anal sex (even with a condom or oral sex dam) until you and your sexual partner have completed treatment. </p>

<p>If you had the one-day course of antibiotics, don’t have sex for at least 1 week.</p>

<p>This is so you don't pass on the infection or get it again.</p>

<h3>When to get tested again</h3>

<p>You won’t usually need to go back for another test after you’ve been treated.</p>

<p>But sometimes a health professional may recommend getting tested again after a few weeks or months. This is to check the infection has gone and you haven’t become infected again.</p>

<p>If you're under 25 and sexually active, it’s recommended you keep getting tested every year and whenever you change sexual partner.</p>


<!--
<p>If you have chlamydia a health professional will give you antibiotics. It's usually one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="azithromycin">azithromycin</a> - you'll take 2 or 4 tablets at once, by mouth</li>
<li><a href="doxycycline">doxycycline</a> - you'll take 2 capsules a day for 1 week, by mouth</li>
</ul>

<p>You might be given different antibiotics if you have an allergy, or you're pregnant or breastfeeding. </p>

<p>If you get tested by a health professional, they might give you antibiotics before you get your test results. This could happen if it's likely that you have chlamydia, for example you have symptoms.</p>
